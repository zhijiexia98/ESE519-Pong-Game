Set up and wrote a high-level graphics library for the LCD; developed a pong game that has two paddles controlled by the physical joysticks on each edge; sounded the buzzer when the “ball” hits the paddle; incorporated wireless control into the game so that the paddles can be controlled wirelessly via the Blynk app; wrote the project in C through AVR libraries in Arduino
