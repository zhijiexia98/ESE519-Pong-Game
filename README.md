# Pong Game
Developed a pong game that has two paddles controlled by the physical joysticks on each edge in C & C++ through AVR libraries in Arduino; \
Set up and wrote a high-level graphics library for the LCD; \
sounded the buzzer when the “ball” hits the paddle; \
Incorporated wireless control into the game so that the paddles can be controlled wirelessly via the Blynk app;
