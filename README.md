# Pong Game
1. Developed a pong game that has two paddles controlled by the physical joysticks on each edge in C & C++ through AVR libraries in Arduino
2. Set up and wrote a high-level graphics library for the LCD
3. Sounded the buzzer when the “ball” hits the paddle
4. Incorporated wireless control into the game so that the paddles can be controlled wirelessly via the Blynk app
